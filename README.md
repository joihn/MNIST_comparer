# MNIST comparer 

This project aims at building a binary classifier for automated comparison of 2 handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) with the use of deep learning methods (Pytorch).
It basically predicts which of the 2 digits is bigger.

Different architectures were compared, notably a siamese Neural Net structure using weight sharing, and 2 loss at different stage of the architectures (called auxiliary loss), please refer to the [report PDF](report.pdf) for more info.

This project was successfully completed in collaboration with Hila Vardi and Niccolò Stefanini, for the EPFL master class *Deep learning* by Prof. François Fleuret
